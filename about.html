                        <h2>Hi, I'm Jean!</h2>
                        <p>
                            I live in New York and I graduated from Stony Brook University with 
                            a major in Technological Systems Management and a minor in Digital Arts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have always loved art and anything aesthetically pleasing. So I figured if I 
                            wanted to pursue something in higher education, I would find a way to apply my 
                            love for art to something everyone would need, technology!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along the way, I picked up many mediums and forms of art. I started from traditonal, 
                            hand-drawn art to digital art and photography. Because of my background in technology, 
                            I became familiar with coding and was I was able to pick up web design and learned 
                            how to make websites both functional and pleasing to the eye for the user's experience.
