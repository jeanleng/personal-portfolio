                    I created a mockup website for an imaginary restaurant named Sweetery that specializes in waffles and drinks. 
                    It features a homepage, menu, and a contact page, and coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive website.

                    This website was a small project for fun that was used characters from a video game called Fire Emblem. 
                    I created a minigame with dialogue and text, where the user gets to choose their character, enemy, and preferred weapon. 
                    The choices will mostly lead to different outcomes and can determine if their character wins against the enemy or not. 
                    The user can restart the game if they choose so since the website is largely dependent on the JavaScript. 
                    This webgame is not mobile responsive, however due to the fact that this is one of my earlier projects, 
                    so the webpage does not fit properly on a mobile screen.

                    This a fun, artistic website featuring a GIF quilt based around the four different seasons. 
                    The four GIFs that are featured in the square represents a window looking outside as the images cycle through the seasons. 
                    The lamp at the top is an added feature that toggles between night and day.
